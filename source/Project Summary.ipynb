    "* **The \"Immunity\" of Calorie Monitoring:** The analysis of Question 1 revealed a massive behavioral impact. Among high-risk individuals (those eating high-calorie food or drinking alcohol), those who monitored calories (SCC) had a severe obesity rate of only 1.6%, compared to 34.1% for those who did not. Fisher’s Exact Test confirmed this is statistically significant (p<0.001), suggesting that self-monitoring effectively mitigates the risks of a poor diet,.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The \"Ordinality\" of Obesity:** The analysis in Question 2 proved that treating obesity as a ranked severity problem (Ordinal Classification) is safer for medical risk assessment than standard classification. While standard XGBoost achieved higher raw accuracy (80.1%), the Ordinal Classifier achieved a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE≈0.35), meaning it rarely confuses severe obesity with normal weight, ensuring \"structural consistency\" in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Personalized vs. General Drivers:** While the general population analysis (Question 6) suggested \"Water Intake\" is a key differentiator, the patient-specific SHAP analysis (Question 2) revealed that for severe cases (Obesity Type III), Physical Activity (FAF) is the dominant \"lever\" for improvement. For specific high-risk patients, increasing activity reduced the risk score by 0.40, whereas increasing water had a negligible effect (0.004). This proves that general advice does not always apply to individual high-risk cases.\n",

Technology Use (TUE) showed a negative correlation with obesity (r=−0.30), likely acting as a proxy for socioeconomic status. The highest risk group was actually the \"Non-Digital Sedentary\" group (No Tech + No Exercise)."
