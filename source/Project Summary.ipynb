    "- The \"Healthy Obese\" Paradox: A major analytical hurdle arose when the data indicated that the `Obesity_Type_III` group had the highest Vegetable Consumption score (`FCVC` $\\approx 3.0$). This contradicted our initial hypothesis that poor diet correlates linearly with weight. I had to look past the numbers to interpret this as a potential \"Reverse Causality\" or \"Self-Reporting Bias,\" where patients with severe obesity are likely already on strict diets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dimensionality Reduction Ambiguity: In the Clustering phase (Question 4), visualizing the 4 clusters via PCA presented a difficulty as Cluster 0 and Cluster 2 showed significant spatial overlap. I initially worried the model failed to separate them. I had to pivot from 2D visual reliance to a Feature Heatmap analysis, which successfully revealed that while they looked similar in space, they were behaviorally distinct (one defined by high vegetable intake, the other by meal skipping).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imbalanced Categorical Features: During the Categorical Analysis, I found that features I expected to be significant, like Smoking (`SMOKE`) and Calorie Monitoring (`SCC`), had extreme imbalance (>95% \"No\"). This lack of variance made them statistically \"dead features,\" forcing me to restructure the analysis to focus on more impactful drivers like Transportation (`MTRANS`) and Snacking (`CAEC`)."

    "- Data Contextualization over Raw Numbers: I learned to question counter-intuitive results.

    "\n",
    "- Profiling over Classification: By applying Unsupervised Learning (K-Means), I moved beyond simply classifying \"How fat is a patient?\" to understanding \"Why are they fat?\". I learned to identify distinct archetypes, discovering that Cluster 1 (Active Tech-Users) needs a completely different medical intervention than Cluster 0 (Sedentary Veggie-Lovers), despite both having weight issues.\n",

    "- Statistical Validation of Gender Nuances: I refined my ability to back up visual observations with statistical rigor. While the charts hinted that men and women gain weight differently, applying the Chi-Square Test ($P \\approx 0$) allowed me to scientifically prove that Male obesity is driven by Environmental factors (Automobiles), whereas Female obesity is significantly linked to Caloric Imbalance (Sedentary behavior)."
